		<h1>Keylong Kishtwar Road, India</h1>
		<p>If 235km of single-track dirt track through some treacherous mountain passes is your idea of a fun road trip, then the Keylong to Kishwar road in India is the one for you.</p>
		<p>There are no safety barriers between you and a drop of thousands of metres into the valley below. Add to that the threat of landslides and changeable weather and you can see why this is one of the most dangerous roads in India.</p>
